## <ins> Results </ins>
1) After fine-tuning a pre-trained MobileNet model achieved about 99.03% Top-1 Accuracy on the Training set and about 73% accuracy on Valid & test data.
2) After fine-tuning a pre-trained VGG16 model achieved about 98.03% Top-1 Accuracy on the Training set and about 70% accuracy on Valid & test data.
3) Using KNN  Algorithm achieved at score:0.404 at K=3
4) Using Random Forest Model achieved at score:0.2


## <ins> Key TakeAways </ins>
1) Through application of Various Machine Learning Algorithms - K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classification and Deep Learning(CNN) Algorithms for image classification we concluded that CNN is the best model for classification of images in our data set.
2) In CNN pretrained models  Mobilenet model is the best in terms of both speed and accuracy in our dataset.
3) MobileNet is the best method and quickest way to implement transfer learning for CNNâ€™s.
